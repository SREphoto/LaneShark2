copy over LaneShark to LaneShark2 folder do not move the files, but copy them and once you have done that disconect from the LaneShark folder
From the files you copied over we will be upgrading from a older version of LaneShark to a higher end version of LaneShark by upgrading the graphics from 16 bit old video game style to a more modern style of graphics and gameplay.  
Things to keep is the mobile version flick to throw ball mechanics and whatever else we need to start off with to get creating started
